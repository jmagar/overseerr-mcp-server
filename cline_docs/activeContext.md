# Active Context

## Current Work
- Implementing image support for search results
- Investigating posterPath handling from Overseerr API
- Planning MCP image response integration

## Recent Changes
1. Created basic MCP server structure
2. Implemented Overseerr service integration
3. Added search and request tools
4. Configured stdio transport for Claude Desktop
5. Simplified environment configuration to essential variables
6. Identified posterPath in search results for future image support

## Next Steps
1. Implement image support:
   - Verify if posterPath URLs are relative to https://overseerr.tootie.tv
   - Add image content type support to MCP responses
   - Test image rendering in Claude
2. Test search functionality with images
3. Test request functionality
4. Add error handling and user feedback improvements

## Current Focus
Implementing image support in search results. We've discovered that:
- Search results include a `posterPath` field
- These paths might be relative to our Overseerr instance (https://overseerr.tootie.tv)
- We need to verify the URL structure and implement proper image response handling
